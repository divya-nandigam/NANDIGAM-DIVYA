## How to run
1. Clone repository.
2. From terminal: `python Problem-1.py` (or Problem-2.py / Problem-3.py / Problem-4.py)
3. Follow the prompt in each program.

## Notes
- All programs accept inputs from standard input and print results to standard output.
- Division by zero is handled in `Problem-1.py` (raises and reports an error).
- I have solved these locally and tested with example inputs.
